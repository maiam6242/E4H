## Introduction
This is a beacon and iOS app system for users of the Metro West Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA) who are visually impaired. The system guides users to various stations which are closest to them, first using audio direction feedback, then upon getting closer to the desired destination, vibration feedback based on proximity. The app is screen reader accessible and high contrast to make it easy to use for users who are visually impaired. 

## Motivation
The MWRTA currently lacks a tool to empower its community members who are blind or visually impaired. The RIDE, the MWRTA's door-to-door paratransit service, offers a solution to people who canâ€™t drive but is still inconvenient for those who wish to travel independently. This system is named Joe Knows, after Joe Weisse, a visually impaired commuter who often travels into Boston. It was created to enable Joe and others like him to accurately and safely navigate to various public transit stops without the aid of others.

## Features

- Determine a user's current location and visualize it on a map  
- Display closest transit stops to a user  
- Navigate to given location to within a foot of actual transit stop destination (as opposed to the typical 30 foot radius from GPS navigation)  
- Navigate to the user's home to within a foot of intended destination  


## Requirements
- iOS 8.0+
- XCode 10.2.1
